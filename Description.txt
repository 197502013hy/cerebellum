Individualized Cerebellar Damage Predicts the Behavioral Disorders in Children with Brainstem Tumors

Steps Overview:

1. Manual Masking of the Brainstem
The brainstem is manually masked out from the imaging data to isolate the regions of interest.

2. Automated Cerebellum Segmentation
   The cerebellum is automatically segmented using a U-net based segmentation package developed by Hanshuo. The code can be accessed here:  https://gitlab.com/shuohan/acapulco/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads

3. Manual Adjustment of the Segmentation
   After automatic segmentation, the results are manually calibrated to ensure accurate delineation of cerebellar regions.

4. Standardization and Volume Extraction using GPR Algorithm

    A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is used to build a standardization model, extracting volumes of all cerebellar regions for each subject.
   10-Fold Cross-Validation: Performed to validate the model using the script n00_10fold_txt.py.
   Z Score Calculation: Computed using the notebook GPR_Nmodel.ipynb.

5.Behavior Prediction Model using Ridge Regression
   A ridge regression model is built to predict behavioral outcomes based on the cerebellar region volumes.

   Model Script: predict_behavior_z.py.
   Permutation Testing: Conducted using the script predict_behavior_z_permu.py.
